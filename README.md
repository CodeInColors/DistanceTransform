## DistanceTransform

The distance transform operation consist in finding the shortest distance of a black pixel to 
a white one. 

This project demonstrates the use of the Meijster Distance Transform algorithm on a 2D array.  
 
While the naive approach have a complexity of o(n^4), this algorithm have one of o(n^3).
As a consequence it is vastyly advantageous for when it comes to process large images.  

When filled with sparse random data, it generally results in cellular gradient patterns.

The Meijster distance trasform is a the core of our NFT project 'nuclei'.  

Have fun playing with it!
