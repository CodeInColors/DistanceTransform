## DistanceTransform

This project demonstrates the use of the Meijster Distance Transform algorithm on a 2D array.
The distance transform operation consist in finding the shortest distance of a black pixel to 
a white one. \

While the naive approach have a complexity of o(n^4), this algorithm have one of o(n^3).
As a consequence it is vastyly advantageous for when it comes to process large images.

When filled with sparse random data, it generally results in cellular gradient patterns. \

The Meijster distance trasform is a the core of our NFT project 'nuclei'.

Have fun playing with it!
